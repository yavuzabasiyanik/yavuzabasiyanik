## Hi there, I'm Yavuz Abasiyanik👋




I’m a passionate software engineer with the innovative and creative mindset of an entrepreneur. 

I have knowledge and experience in building dynamic web applications using JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Python, PostgreSQL, and Flask. I love all the processes in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) under Agile Project Management Methodology. I have a reputation for shipping quality code, being a strong pair, and working well across scrum teams. In addition, I (an awarded chess player) have the ability to work dependently on assigned tasks by creating my own strategies, etc.
